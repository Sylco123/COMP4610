Repository for my GUI class

part1 of Homework4:
It was very interesting to work on this one. I did not do homework 3 entirely correctly. I 
made a mistake in using alerts, which were popups. With Nuno's help, I was able to start this one up with a better understanding of what to do for this one. I used geeks for geeks for some explanation on how to use jquery for validation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/form-validation-using-jquery/ . The main site gave a nice little guideline on all of it as well https://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/ .   
I learned a lot with this one, I also polished the style.css to add a visually better table for clarity.
