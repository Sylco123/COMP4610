This assignment proved to be more challenging in a lot of ways than the previous assignments. My code had a lot of help from online research. I have to credit a lot of the help recieved this time as many parts of the assignment ended up confusing me. Even still, I had to go back on many sections that I thought I had done properly only to assess it next to the rubric requirements of the game only to find out that I wasn't doing it fully correctly. I managed to get the pieces to track on the scoring, but it works very finnicky and for some reason it seems to duplicate the object whenever I move it to change the score. One of the positive things I was able to figure out was putting the pieces away when I wanted to change the combination of words by putting it in the tileholder. However, there were some things as well that I couldn't get working, like the valid word function which I could not get to work, but it was an extra credit task.
