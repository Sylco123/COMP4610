HW4 Part 2.
There was a good amount that went into this one, mostly learning the implementation of the sliders. Just like with the last one I had to fix how the error messages were in my hw3. This tutorial helped: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Uhdjoay99xo. The one struggle I had was that the styling I did for the part 1 did not work for how I made this part, I assume I could have done more with jquery to make it more interesting but I did not manage the time. If I have the time I will resubmit late to fix that. i also struggled with deleting the table, the method I had tried was also not working.


Here are the sources I used to understand the slider in jquery:
